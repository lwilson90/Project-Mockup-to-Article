Question 1
	I learned how to add a title to a link, so you can see the link address when you mouse over. I noticed that feature in the PDF, so added to html document just in case. Also, I used the delete element over the strike element because according to MDN it's obsolete in HTML5. Moreover, I decided to use the emphasis and bold elements over their predecessors for my HTML5 document.

Question 2 

	The repetitiveness of tags allowed me to copy and paste. The previous quizzes allowed me to quickly create links and the image. 

Question 3

	The difficult part was making sure to close tags, so I started adding the start/close tags at same time. Also, remembering to add all the quotation marks and angle brackets.

Question 4

	I utilized a Google and MDN to observe difference between HTML5 (version used) versus HTML4 elements. The links in the PDF didn't change colors once you clicked or hover over, so I wanted the same features for my HTML5 document. I added link, visited, hover, and active attributes with a blue value. Also, I remembered the importance of reviewing the code line by line to catch simple errors.
